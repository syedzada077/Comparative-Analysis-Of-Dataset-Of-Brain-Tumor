Performance Metrics
Performance metrics are calculated for each algorithm to provide a comprehensive comparative analysis. These metrics include:

Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
